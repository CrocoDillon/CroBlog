# CroBlog

Zend Framework 2 Blog module.

## Goals

These are the features I try to focus on during development of this module.

*   BlogService with basic CRUD functionality.
*   Easy to extend every part of the module.
*   Few or no dependencies other then ZF2.
*   Feed generation, both RSS and Atom.
*   Taxonomy support, e.g. categories, tags or series.

## No goals

CroBlog wonâ€™t cover these features, however I try to make it as convenient as possible to use 3rd-party modules or frameworks for them.

*   User registration or authorization.
*   Markup rendering, e.g. Markdown.
*   Blog post comments.
*   Caching.

## Installation

Using composer or by cloning this repo. Will add detailed instructions as soon as basic CRUD functionality is ready.
